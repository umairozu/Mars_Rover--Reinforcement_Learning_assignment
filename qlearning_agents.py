Do NOT modify the constructors or the provided query methods.

    By now Rover-7 has actually landed, and it is a very different
    situation from the one in Q1. Mission Control no longer has a
    clean, uploaded terrain map: the rover is in an unexplored
    patch of the Red Planet, the solar interference budget is
    whatever the weather gives it, and the only way to learn the
    world is to drive around in it. Every action returns a noisy
    observation of the next cell and the reward (or crater) you
    found there. That is the setting of reinforcement learning:
    learn an optimal policy purely from experience, without ever
    inspecting a transition table.

    In Q3 you will implement tabular Q-learning. Q4 is an
    epsilon-greedy exploration policy on top of the same Q-table.
    Q5 re-skins the same agent for Rover-7's own hyper-parameters
    and verifies it converges on Mars grids and the Crawler robot.

    every state is worth exactly zero -- a neutral, optimism-free
    prior that matches the standard textbook version of Q-learning.

    training loop via ``observe_transition``. Query methods
