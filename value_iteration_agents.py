students/value_iteration_agents.py -- Q1 student file (Python 3.10+).

STUDENT FILE -- you fill in the three methods marked
``*** YOUR CODE HERE ***``. Do NOT modify the constructor or the
four provided query methods at the bottom of the class.

    Mission Control has provided complete terrain maps for the
    region Rover-7 is about to cross. That means you, the flight
    software engineer, know the full Markov decision process before
    the rover touches down: every state, every legal action, the
    probability that the solar wind will nudge a drive command
    sideways, and the reward (or penalty) for each possible
    outcome. Your job is to plan ahead -- compute an optimal
    policy *before* deployment so that when Rover-7 wakes up on
    the surface it already knows what to do from every square on
    the map.

    In Q1 you will implement tabular value iteration, the classic
    planning algorithm that does exactly that: it repeatedly sweeps
    the state space, updating each state's value from the values
    of its successors under the current estimate. After a few
    dozen sweeps the values converge and the greedy policy with
    respect to those values is optimal.

You will fill in three methods below. Read each docstring carefully
-- it describes both *what* to compute and *which* pieces of the
MDP interface (``get_transition_states_and_probs``, ``get_reward``)
fit together to make it happen.

    Mission Control hands you a :class:`env.mdp.MarkovDecisionProcess`
    describing the planet surface. Because the model is known, you
    can compute the optimal value function V*(s) offline -- no
    experience required -- and then, at query time, read off the
    greedy action at any state as ``pi*(s) = argmax_a Q*(s, a)``.

    The agent stores its current estimate of V in ``self.values``, a
    :class:`util.Counter` mapping each state to a scalar. States
    the agent has not yet touched read as 0 by virtue of Counter's
    missing-key default -- exactly the right initial value for a

        have already been updated in the current sweep. Concretely,
        create a fresh :class:`util.Counter`, fill it in using the
        current ``self.values`` to look up successor values, and

        with the new counter.

        Terminal states -- the ones for which
        ``self.mdp.is_terminal`` returns ``True`` -- keep a value
        of 0 and should simply be skipped. A state that
        ``mdp.get_possible_actions`` reports as having no legal
        actions should also be left at 0.

        below, and the body of this method becomes a two-line loop.
