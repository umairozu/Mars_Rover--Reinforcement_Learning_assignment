students/analysis.py -- Q2 student file (Python 3.10+).

STUDENT FILE -- you fill in the five policy-profile functions below.

    === Mission Control Policy Briefing ===

    The Canyon Grid is a narrow strip of terrain between two
    mission-critical objectives and a very long drop. At the top of
    the canyon wall there is a *close* extraction point worth +1
    reward -- think of it as a handful of easily-grabbed surface
    samples on a ledge just above the rover. Further along and
    harder to reach, the *distant* sample depot sits at +10: a
    much richer payload, but the rover has to traverse more of the
    canyon to get there. Running along the bottom of the whole map
    is a crater cliff (a row of -10 tiles) -- one wrong step down
    there ends the mission.

    Depending on how you tune the planner's knobs, value iteration
    will produce dramatically different policies: a risk-tolerant
    cliff run, a safe upper detour, a "stall forever" policy that
    refuses to commit to any exit, and everything in between.

    Your job in Q2 is to find, for each of five distinct behaviours
    Mission Control wants to see, a setting of three parameters
    that produces that behaviour when you run
    :class:`students.value_iteration_agents.ValueIterationAgent`
    on the ``canyon`` grid. The knobs you can turn are:

    * ``discount``       -- the planner's gamma. Small values
      (close to 0) make the rover myopic and reluctant to walk
      far for a bigger reward; large values (close to 1) reward
      patient travel.
    * ``noise``          -- the slip probability that the Mars
      grid uses for stochastic transitions. With ``noise == 0``
      the rover can hug the cliff and never actually fall off;
      with non-zero noise the cliff becomes genuinely dangerous
      because any step along it might slip downward.
    * ``living_reward``  -- the reward earned on every
      non-extraction step. Negative values punish dawdling;
      positive values reward it (and if the bonus is big enough,
      can tip the optimal policy into refusing to ever terminate).

Each of the five functions should return a tuple
``(discount, noise, living_reward)`` that makes value iteration
pick the indicated behaviour on the Canyon Grid. If you decide a
particular combination cannot be achieved with any setting of the
three parameters, return the literal string ``'NOT POSSIBLE'``
instead -- that is the signal the autograder recognises.

Every stub currently returns ``'NOT POSSIBLE'``; change the body
of each function to your chosen tuple once you have worked out
the tuning. You may find it helpful to try a setting in the GUI
first::

    python mars_rover.py -a value -i 100 -g canyon \\
        --discount 0.9 --noise 0.2 --living-reward -0.1

and only commit to a final tuple once the arrows on screen match
the behaviour described.

    Mission Control wants the rover to grab the quick +1 ledge
    samples and to race there along the bottom of the canyon,
    right next to the crater cliff. "Risky" means the agent
    should be willing to walk along tiles adjacent to the -10
    cliff row; "close exit" means the greedy policy should take
    the +1 and not the +10.
